# [Public](https://public.com) API

A TypeScript compatible library for interacting with the Public API. This is
not affiliated with Public and is not meant for production. Use at your own
discretion.

### TODO:

- Full TS support on response data
- Full TS support on API options
  - Requires some communication with the Public team to specify all enums in
    use
